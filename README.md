Database Project

This Project involves me creating a datebase, this project involves me creating my version of SQL (NOTE: That this is not a full version of SQL and thus oes not have all the functionality of true SQL).
This comes with a already created file named Students that has the binary file with all of its information preloaded into the file, along with the Filenames name .txt file needed to load the table Students into the program.
